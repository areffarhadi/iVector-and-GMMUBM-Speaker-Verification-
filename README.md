# iVector_GMMUBM_Speaker_Verification 
MATLAB implementation of DBN-based Speaker Verification using iVector and GMMUBM on the NIST04 and NIST08 dataset
in this code we use Deep Belief Network as post-processing in speech feature extraction stage to generate more efficient features using MFCC as DBN input.

used MATLAB toolboxes:
  * DeeBNet
  * MSRIdentityToolkit
